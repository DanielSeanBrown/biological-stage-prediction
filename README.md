# Bioloigical Process Stage Prediction from Gene Expression Values

This project aimed to use reproducible statistical methods to build models and gain insights into how gene expression levels can be used to predict the relevant stage within a biological process. Both supervised and unsupervised learning methods were used, examining differing techniques for recognising patterns in continuous data. Further, data simulation was performed to generate insight into model performance and stability. Logistic regression yielded interpretable model coefficients for direct prediction from gene expression levels, whereas a random forest model was produced for use as a high-performance classifier. Linear discriminant analysis was also used to gain an accurate two-dimensional projection of the 20-feature wide dataset. On unsupervised techniques, a gaussian mixture model yielded accurate clustering and principal component analysis was performed to contrast with linear discriminant analysis. Clustering was also performed on simulated model coefficients.
